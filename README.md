As a beginner in web development, one of the projects that you can undertake is creating a simple calculator. This project will not only help you understand the basics of HTML and CSS, but it will also give you an insight into how you can add functionality to a user interface using JavaScript.
o get started, we will first need to create a basic HTML file. In this file, we will include the main structure for our calculator.

We will start by creating a div element and giving it the class of container. This div will act as a container for our calculator.Next, we will add buttons and an input field to the calculator. We will use the button element to create the buttons, and the input element to create the input field.

After creating the files just paste the following codes into your file. Make sure to save your HTML document with a .html extension, so that it can be properly viewed in a web browser.

This is the basic structure of our calculator using HTML, and now we can move on to styling it using CSS.

Step 2 (CSS Code):


Once the basic HTML structure of the calculator is in place, the next step is to add styling to the calculator using CSS. CSS allows us to control the visual appearance of the website, including things like layout, color, and typography.

Next, we will create our CSS file. In this section, we will use CSS to style our calculator. We will give it a basic layout, change the font and background color, and add hover effects to the buttons.

This will give our calculator an upgraded presentation. Create a CSS file with the name of styles.css and paste the given codes into your CSS file. Remember that you must create a file with the .css extension.![Screenshot 2024-05-24 084436](https://github.com/HarsInd/html_css_caluclator/assets/168928630/ec2303f9-3c5b-4540-b45f-6f8feb9bbadb)
